### THE FIRST BETA RELEASE OF TITANIUM!!!!

This is the first beta release of Titanium, my experimental project of a minimalistic interpreted programming language written in TypeScript. Even though Titanium still lacks several features found in other more robust programming languages, such as Java and C++, I'm still very proud of what I've achieved so far. 

There's still a lot to learn, of course, many hidden bugs that I haven't caught to fix, many things to be rewritten from scratch, and so on. I've done lots of mistakes in this project and I've regretted having made some choices because they led me to have to rewrite or rethink some parts of the project later, but I've learned a lot from those mistakes.

I'd like to sincerely thank my friends Gustavo Nogueira, Gustavo Alberto Tilpe, and Matheus do Espirito Santo for all the support, motivation, suggestions and ideas (and also for finding some bugs that I hadn't caught before xD). You are all very important to me and, without you, this project would have never existed in the first place.
