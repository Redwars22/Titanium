# TITANIUM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## INTRODUCTION

Titanium is a fictional programming language designed specifically for one of my stories. It's been developed by the fictional characters Gustavo, Matheus and Léo Andrew. Since it's all fictional, there's no compiler for it, but you can develop one for it if you want. All the documentation about its grammar and syntax is here, you can use it as the basis for the compiller. Typologically, Titanium is a … dynamically typed programming language with a Python/Lua-like syntax. It was designed to be easy to write and remember and as such it has short keywords, inspired by Assembly's three letter keywords. Here's an example of what Titanium looks like:

```jsx

START

    --This is a single line comment in Titanium

    Output("Hello, world!")

END

```

DATA TYPES

Titanium is mostly a dynamically typed programming language and types are optional, except for constants and arrays. It has five main data types:




| KEYWORD | DESCRIPTION |

| --- | --- |

| STR | Strings of text and characters  |

| NUM | Either positive or negative integer numbers |

| REAL | Float and double |

| BOOL | Boolean |

| NULL | Either null or undefined  |

Variables can be typed using the following syntax:

```jsx

DECL name: STR = "Dylan"

DECL age: NUM = 18

DECL height: REAL = 1.75

DECL isOverEighteen: BOOLEAN = TRUE

DECL nickname: NULL = undefined

```
