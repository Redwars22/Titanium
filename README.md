> # ⚠️ Dear user,
> Titanium and Arctic are two projects of mine and my goal was to implement an intepreted minimalistic programming language.
> These repos probably won't be updated from now on, mainly due to the lack of time and motivation to keep working on those projects.
> However, if you want to try them all, please read their docs and download their interpreters and try writing a few simple programs using them. If you want to clone any of those projects and keep working on them or even use them as a basis for your own programming language, feel free to do so.
> A huge hug from @AndrewNation!

> # 💥️ TITANIUM 1.4.0 - JAMMY JAKARTA
> This version includes procedures, IF and FOR control structures and a few bug fixes and new features!
>
> 👇️ [DOWNLOAD IT NOW!](https://github.com/Redwars22/AndrewToolchain/releases/tag/v1.4.0-release-candidate)


> ⚠️ For the source code and downloadable zip files of Titanium CLI, please visit the AndrewToolchain repository [here](https://github.com/Redwars22/AndrewToolchain). From now on, all Titanium releases will be published in that repository.

Titanium is a minimalist interpreted fictional programming language designed for one of my stories (actually, it was initially planned to be fictional, but I want to take it a step further, if possible). It’s been developed by the fictional characters Matheus, Gustavo N, and Léo Andrew. The language itself and its online playground (which is currently the only way you can run Titanium) are being written in TypeScript and then compiled to JS. Python and Lua have heavily inspired Titanium’s syntax and its goal is to be easy to read and understand, clear, and concise. 

Since its goal was to be a very minimalist programming language, it contains few keywords and functionalities, but you should be able to declare variables and constants, print them to the screen, get input from the user, generate random numbers, use boolean, use the ternary operator, and even converting decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal (will be added later). The language, however, doesn't come with more complex things, such as functions and the object-oriented paradigm (although it does support simple procedures and if and for control structures). Since its goal is to be as minimalist and as simple as possible, I probably won’t be adding those features to the language. 

However, I might create a superset of it in the future which would include those aforementioned things (just like TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript). Also, two of Titanium’s outstanding characteristics are the use of capitalized keywords, inspired by COBOL, and the use of short keywords, with an average of three or four letters. It’s also worth mentioning that spaces in Titanium are mandatory, in order to keep the code readable and organized.

```jsx
--This is a single-line comment in Titanium
print("Hello, world!")
```
