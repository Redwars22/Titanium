Titanium is a general-purpose fictional programming language designed specifically for one of my stories (actually, it was planned to be fictional, initially, but I want to take it a step further, if possible). It's been developed by the fictional characters Matheus, Gustavo N, and LÃ©o Andrew. The language itself and its playground are currently being written in TypeScript. Furthermore, Titanium is a multi-paradigm dynamically typed programming language with a Python/Lua-like syntax. It was designed to be easy to write and remember and as such, it has short keywords, inspired by Assembly's three-letter keywords and its keywords are written capitalized, just like in COBOL. Here's an example of what Titanium looks like:

```jsx
START
    --This is a single-line comment in Titanium
    print("Hello, world!")
END
```
